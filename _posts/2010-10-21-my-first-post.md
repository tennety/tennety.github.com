All the cool kids were doing it, so I tried it too. I moved from Wordpress to Jekyll. It sounded so perfect, no UI, no databases to maintain, Git for version control, and my trusty [text editor](http://vim.org) to write posts with. What could _possibly_ go wrong?

And since you are reading this, I was successful. Eventually.

It all started as a bug in my head when I was trying to educate myself on Rack and Sinatra. I saw mention of Toto and Jekyll, and mused taking the dive for a while, but hesitated till the awesomely cool [Adam McCrea](http://twitter.com/adamlogic) gave a talk about Jekyll at our [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com/). As with anything he gives a talk about, it all sounded perfectly clear and straightforward. Just write, he seemed to say, let Ruby do the rest. Of course, I thought, I'll have it up by tonight!

Not quite, unfortunately.
