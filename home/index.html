	<h1>Hi.</h1>

	<p>Have you ever been taken hostage by an idea? Felt like you <em>had</em> to do its bidding before you could get back to sanity? I have, too.</p>
	<p>If you're in the grip of one right now, and don't know who to call, <a href='/contact'>send out a signal</a>, or look me up at my hideouts &mdash;

	<h2>This is me.</h2>

	<p>I have several secret identities: husband, father, Ruby developer. But at heart I'm an ideator and imaginator (Yeah, I know those aren't real words, but I still like them).</p>
        <p>In my superhero guise, you will find me capturing elusive ideas and giving them form.</p>
